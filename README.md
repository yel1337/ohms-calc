# ohms-calc
Terminal Based Ohms Calculator written in C.
Calculate Voltage (V): Input the values of current (I) and resistance (R) to determine the voltage across a circuit element.
Calculate Current (I): Provide the voltage (V) and resistance (R) values to find the current flowing through a circuit.
Calculate Resistance (R): Specify the voltage (V) and current (I) to compute the resistance of a circuit component.
