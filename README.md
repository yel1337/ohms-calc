# CLI Ohms Calculator

This is a command-line interface (CLI) Ohms calculator written in C, designed to quickly and efficiently calculate resistance, voltage, and current in electrical circuits based on Ohm's Law.

# Features
*Ohm's Law Calculation: Quickly calculate resistance (R), voltage (V) and current (I) using Ohm's Law formulas.
*Interactive CLI Interface: User-friendly interface for inputting values and selecting calculations.
*Error Handling: Robust error handling to ensure accurate calculations and user-friendly error messages.
*Cross-Platform Compatibility: Compatible with various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
*Lightweight and Fast: Written in C for optimal performance and minimal resource usage.

# How to Use: (In Linux)
1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/yel1337/ohms-calc.git
2. Compile the Code: go to its directory then gcc -o ohms ohms-calc.c
3. Run the Program: ./ohms
# How to Use: (In Windows)
1. First, you must have installed gcc on your Windows Operating System. Refer to MinGW-w64 website: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ and follow its instructions
2. Open command prompt/CMD and clone the repository
3. Compile it by typing the command: gcc -o ohms ohms-calc.c then ./ohms
# How to Use: (In MacOS)
1. Similar as in linux, make sure gcc is installed.
2. Compile the code.

# Usage: 
* Upon running the program, follow the prompts to input values and select the desired calculation.
* Choose from options such as calculating resistance (R), voltage (V) and current (I)
* Enter the known values when prompted and get the result instantly.
